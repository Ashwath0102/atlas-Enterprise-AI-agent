Sometimes a subscription owner (`Sold To:` contact) may want to associate the billing account (and related subscriptions) with more CustomersDot users, or transfer the billing account / subscription ownership.

This process would also apply for requests to send a license to a different email other than the `Sold To:` contact.

Occasionally, Billing Team may forward requests / tickets to our team to vet and then assist with changing `Sold To:` details.  The processes below would apply for those tickets as well.

#### CustomersDot changes can update Zuora Sold To contact

**Important note:** Any time a CustomersDot user is edited via the Admin, the Zuora account contact associated with the customer is updated. In case there is no Zuora contact with the same email, the Zuora account `Sold To:` address is replaced.

If the workflow requires editing a CustomersDot user (Customer record) via the Admin, click `Save` on the user with the same email as the original `Sold To:` contact **LAST**, to ensure they remain the `Sold To:` on their Zuora account. Refer to the workflow [Update Zuora Sold To contact using CustomersDot](#update-zuora-sold-to-contact-using-customersdot).

Creating a new Billing Account Membership for a user will not update the Zuora `Sold To:` contact.

## Add subscription management contact

Provide subscription access to additional CustomersDot user by creating billing account membership.

1. Verify the requestor's identity as outlined under [ownership verification](#ownership-verification).
1. Ensure the requestor has a Customer record in [CustomersDot](https://customers.gitlab.com).
1. Identify the CustomersDot billing account for the provided Zuora account, and
   save the user and billing account names for use in upcoming steps.
1. Navigate to the `Billing account memberships` section in the left navigation
   area.
1. Select the `+ Add new` action.
1. Using the information you saved earlier, select the correct `CustomersDot`
   user and `CustomersDot billing account` for the new subscription management
   request. The CustomersDot user can be uniquely located by its `Email` and
   the billing_account by its `zuora_account_id`.
1. Click `Save`.
1. Ensure the `Login activated` checkbox for the CustomersDot user is **checked**. If it is not, then [confirm the CustomersDot account login status](#confirm-the-customersdot-account-login-status).

**Note:** If a CustomersDot user already has a billing account membership, it is not currently possible to create a second billing account membership for them. Confirm with the existing CustomersDot user if they want to stop managing the existing subscriptions before [removing the existing billing account membership](#remove-a-billing-account-membership).

## Change subscription management contact workflow

Use this workflow for requests to change subscription owner, transfer ownership, or regaining access to a subscription that was set up by another person not in the organization anymore.

### Self-service option

Consider using the [Support::L&R::Change Customers Portal Contact](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/zendesk-global/macros/-/blob/master/macros/active/Support/Self-Managed/Change%20Customers%20Portal%20Contact.yaml) macro so the requester can self-service. **Important**: Do not add the existing `Sold To:` contact as a CC. The requester would see the email address, which would be considered a leak of Personal Data.

If the requester **does not** have a Customers Portal account but can access the previous owner's Customer Portal account or email address, direct them to:

1. Trigger a [one time sign-in link](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in?legacy=true) to the existing owner's email.
1. [Claim the account](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/customers_portal/#change-profile-owner-information) by changing over the profile owner details.
1. [Link their GitLab account](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/customers_portal/#link-a-gitlabcom-account) to the Customers Portal account or [change the linked account](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/customers_portal/#change-the-linked-account) for authentication.
1. Once the requester has updated the account on the Customers Portal, verify that the `Sold To:` contact in the Zuora account matches the Customers Portal account. Follow the [Update Zuora Sold To contact using CustomersDot workflow](#update-zuora-sold-to-contact-using-customersdot) if they do not match.

If the requester has an existing Customers Portal account, they can ask current subscription contacts to [invite them as a billing account manager](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/customers_portal/#add-a-billing-account-manager).

#### Error: Group Owner lacks access to subscription's Billing Account

**Note:** These messages are temporary while we implement [multiple BillingAccount membership](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/work_items/8986) for CustomersDot users.

A customer can receive a message in Customers Portal that includes the phrase:

> You're signed in as a GitLab group Owner, but either this subscription doesn't exist or you don't have access to manage its billing account.

**Cause:**

This message appears when a customer is an Owner of a group with a linked subscription, but their Customers Portal account either:

- Does not have access to that subscription
- Is a billing account manager of a different billing account
- Is attempting to access a URL with an invalid or incorrect subscription name
- The subscription does not exist or cannot be found

**Resolution Steps:**

1. Complete the [ownership verification](#ownership-verification) process.
1. Locate the billing account associated with the subscription the customer is trying to access.
1. **If the subscription does not exist:**
   - Determine the correct subscription and next steps, or
   - Request assistance in the [spt_pod_licensing-subscription](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0ANNKJSNBE) channel.
1. **If the subscription exists** and the customer manages a different billing account:
   1. Confirm with the customer whether they accept losing access to their current billing account.
   1. **If they accept:** Follow the [Remove a billing account membership workflow](#remove-a-billing-account-membership) to remove their association from the current billing account.
   1. **If they decline:** Provide alternative options or request assistance in the [spt_pod_licensing-subscription](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0ANNKJSNBE) channel.
1. Follow the [Add subscription management contact workflow](#add-subscription-management-contact) to associate the customer with the correct billing account.

#### Message "Your account is already linked to another billing account" reported

A customer receives an email with the message:

> <Contact Name> has invited you to manage the GitLab subscription for <Company Name>.
> However, your account is already linked to another billing account, and cannot be associated with two billing accounts at the same time. Please contact GitLab Support for assistance.

This happens when a customer is a billing account manager of a separate billing account.

1. If the ticket requester is an existing billing account manager or the invited contact
   - Go to the [`Billing account invites` page](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/billing_account_invite).
   - Find the invite related to the invited contact's email.
   - Ensure either the `Email` or the `Billing Account` in the invite matches the requester's CustomersDot account details, then proceed to step 3.
   - Proceed to step 2 if the details do not match.
1. If the ticket requester is **not** an existing billing account manager nor the invited contact (for example, if a reseller opens the ticket or the ticket is a customer-facing internal request), follow the [ownership verification](#ownership-verification) process first.
1. Follow [Remove a billing account membership workflow](#remove-a-billing-account-membership) to remove association from the contact's current billing account.
1. Follow [Add subscription management contact workflow](#add-subscription-management-contact) to associate the customer to the billing account to which they were invited.

#### Error "Email has already been taken" reported

If the requester follows the [self-service option](#self-service-option) and receives the error "Email has already been taken", this indicates the new account owner already has an existing CustomersDot account. Direct them to follow the steps to [add a billing account manager](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/customers_portal/#add-a-billing-account-manager) instead.

### Support-assisted option

This process should be a last resort for **all customers** (including reseller customers). Only after ruling out the [self-service option](#self-service-option) above will we consider making the requested ownership change.

First, verify the customer's identity as outlined under [ownership verification](#ownership-verification).

#### Process for existing CustomersDot user

**Warning**: A new `Customer` record will be created if updating a billing account contact to an email address for which a `Customer` record doesn't yet exist. So please be sure to follow the steps in the presented order to avoid this side-effect, or follow the [Process for non-existing CustomersDot user](#process-for-non-existing-customersdot-user), if the requestor is not an existing CustomersDot user.

If the requestor is an existing CustomersDot user when doing an email search:

1. Follow [Add subscription management contact workflow](#add-subscription-management-contact).
1. Follow [Remove a billing account membership workflow](#remove-a-billing-account-membership) to remove association to the subscription of the previous `Sold To:` contact.
1. Follow [Update Zuora Sold To contact using CustomersDot workflow](#update-zuora-sold-to-contact-using-customersdot).

#### Process for non-existing CustomersDot user

If the requestor is not an existing CustomersDot user when doing an email search:

1. Edit the `Name` and `Email` of the current `Sold To:` contact's CustomersDot customer account to the new contact, check the box `Skip email confirmation` and click `Save`.
1. Check if the CustomersDot account is linked to a GitLab.com account:
      - On the CustomersDot account, navigate to the `Show` tab and confirm there is a value under `Uid`. The `Uid` is the ID of a GitLab account which can be checked via the Users API `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/users/<Uid>`
      - On the CustomersDot account, unlink the GitLab user account by selecting the **Unlink GitLab User** tab. This should prepopulate the GitLab username and associated account to unlink.
1. Trigger a [one time sign-in link](https://customers.gitlab.com/customers/sign_in?legacy=true) to the new email. Request the customer to [Link their GitLab account](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/customers_portal/#link-a-gitlabcom-account) to the CustomersDot account.
1. Confirm that the `Sold To:` contact in the Billing account is also updated, otherwise follow [Update Zuora Sold To contact using CustomersDot workflow](#update-zuora-sold-to-contact-using-customersdot).

## Other notable workflows involving CustomersDot

### Ownership verification

**Note 1:**  For any of the options below, do not add the existing `Sold To:` contact as a CC. The requester would see that email address, which would be considered a leak of Personal Data.

**Note 2:** We do not accept vouches from GitLab Team Members (including Account Owners listed in SFDC) as proof of a customer's association to a subscription.

**Note 3:** If you need to escalate any ownership verification requests to the Legal and Compliance team please open a [Subscription-Ownership-Change-Escalation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Subscription-Ownership-Change-Escalation) issue.

**Note 4:** This process is slightly more stringent than that of the steps for [proving entitlement to Manage Support Contacts](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/articles/11626528150172).  Notably, we cannot accept screenshots for proving entitlement to subscription management access.

We need **one** of the following in order to verify eligibility for the subscription ownership change:

1. Approval from the existing contact
   - If the billing account has different `Sold To:` and `Bill To:` contacts, we can only accept approval from the existing `Sold To:` contact.
   - The `Bill To:` contact must provide a recent GitLab invoice.
1. Prior subscription contract
1. Recent GitLab invoice (last 12 months)
   - This option is not available for customers who purchased through a reseller. If the license key is unactivated at the time of the request, see Option 6. below, if the license has already been activated, the reseller can either open a ticket with this request or the customer can CC the reseller and also confirm that they would like to authorize the reseller to participate in the ticket. The reseller can then provide the invoice as proof of identity.
1. Copy of last loaded license (Self-Managed only) in text format only.
   - Screenshots are not valid
   - To obtain the license code:
     - GitLab version 14.2 and newer: Use [license usage export](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/license_usage/#export-license-usage).
     - GitLab version 14.1, run the command `sudo gitlab-rails runner 'print License.current.data'` on the GitLab instance. N.B. this command can take a few minutes to complete.
     - GitLab versions older than 14.1, use `Download license` from the `Admin area > License` page.
   - License file can be decoded in customersDot from `Licenses` -> `Validate License` (`/admin/license/validate_license`)
   - **Copies of license activation code emails** are not permissible articles of proof.
      - Please use the Redaction Zendesk app to censor the activation code if such a cloud activation code email is provided.
1. For a SaaS customer you can verify that the ticket requestor is an owner in the namespace attached to the subscription by:
   1. Asking them to:
      1. Login to their gitlab.com namespace as a group owner.
      1. Open an API call to their namespace URL: "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/namespaces/<customer_namespace>/gitlab_subscription".
      1. Copy/paste the returned data to the support ticket.
   1. Using a gitlab.com admin account to verify the accuracy of the provided
      subscription data and then approving or denying the request accordingly.
1. Option for unactivated licenses purchased through a reseller only: A reseller can vouch for an account ownership change through a ticket request. The reseller can open a ticket, or alternatively, the customer can CC the reseller to authorize their request.
   1. [Confirm that the subscription was purchased through a reseller](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/working_with_reseller_related_requests#identifying-whether-a-customer-purchased-through-reseller)
   1. Verify that the email address domain used by the ticket requester matches the `Sold To` email domain of the `Invoice Owner` account in Zuora as detailed in the related [legal compliance issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/legal-and-compliance/-/issues/1564#note_1451657920). In cases where a customer has made a purchase through a series of resellers, the reseller matching the email domain identified in Zuora as the `Invoice owner` of the subscription should be used for verification confirmation.

### Fixing typos

Support may receive an [Internal Request](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/working_internal_requests/) to correct a typo in a customer's email address and resend the license or activation code to a valid address. Use the following workflow to validate such requests before making any changes:

1. (Cloud license only, proceed to step 2 for Offline/Legacy) In CustomersDot, find the subscription name on the [Cloud Activation](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/cloud_activation) page. Ensure the activation code has not been used; if it has not been activated yet, there will be no "Self Managed Instance Activations" tab for this cloud activation.
1. [Check the Mailgun logs](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/customersdot/troubleshoot_errors_while_making_purchases/#troubleshooting-email-delivery-from-customerdot) to verify that the license email was sent but failed to reach the intended customer. If the email with the typo does not exist, the Mailgun log entry will display a failed mail delivery attempt (commonly shown as a **550 error code**).
1. Log the error by attaching a Mailgun log in text form to the ticket.
1. Validate the correct email address with the Account Manager who submitted the request in writing before correcting the typo.
1. Update the Sold to contact email address on the Billing Account and the related Customers Portal account.
1. Resend the license or activation code to the corrected email address.
1. Advise the Account Manager to update the email for the Contact in SFDC for their records.

### Update Zuora Sold To contact using CustomersDot

1. Navigate to the `Billing account contacts` section of the `CustomersDot Admin` page.
1. From there you can search for the account to be updated in Zuora by searching for the existing email address for either the `Bill To:` or the `Sold To:` on record.
1. Once the account has been located it may be edited by selecting the small pencil icon located at the right side of the page.
1. On the edit page you will see a highlighted warning banner near the top of the page indicating whether you will be editing the `sold to contact`, the `bill to contact`, or the `sold to and bill to contact`.
1. Once you have confirmed the correct account in the `Billing account contacts` section of the `CustomerDot Admin` page, you may update the relevant fields.  Normally this is the `First name`, `Last name`, and `Email address`.  The physical address may be updated here as well, if desired.
1. Upon completion of the changes, click the `Save` button near the bottom of the page.
1. To confirm the changes propogated properly this can be done by verifying in Zuora that the `Sold To:` and/or the `Bill To:` contacts have been updated.

If the Zuora information is not updated properly, or the `Bill To:` and the `Sold To:` records have the same account and the customer needs them to be separate people, you may hand the ticket to the Billing team using the [Zuora contact change workflow](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/billing_contact_change_payments/#zuora-contact-change) to update the relevant information.

### Remove a billing account membership

#### Self-service option

Subscription contacts have the ability to [remove existing billing account managers who already have access to their billing information.](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/customers_portal/#remove-a-billing-account-manager).

An existing billing account manager can also [cancel invitations that were sent to potential billing account managers that haven't been accepted yet.](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/customers_portal/#revoke-a-billing-account-manager-invitation)

#### Support-assisted option

This process should be a last resort for **all customers** (including reseller customers). Only after ruling out the [self-service option](#self-service-option-1) above will we consider making the requested change.

First, verify the customer's identity as outlined under [ownership verification](#ownership-verification) before removing an existing billing account membership:

1. Navigate to the `Billing account memberships` section.
1. Locate the correct billing account membership by searching for the CustomersDot user's email.
1. Open the billing account membership and select `x Delete` action.
1. Confirm the correct billing account membership is selected.
1. Select `Yes, I'm sure`.
1. See the `Billing account membership successfully deleted`  success notification.
1. Refer to [Add subscription management contact](#add-subscription-management-contact) if you want to add a new billing account membership to the CustomersDot user.

**Note:** If the deleted billing account membership was the only one associated with the billing account, please ensure that this is the desired state.

### Confirm the CustomersDot account login status

If the `Login activated` checkbox for a CustomersDot account is **not checked**, then:

1. Click the `History` tab and search for `login_activated = false`. If you find an entry dated any time **after** the `create` entry, that indicates that we may have intentionally disabled login for this customer. Do not proceed with enabling login unless you are sure. For help, ask for guidance in the `#support_licensing_subscription channel`.
1. To enable the customer's login:
   1. Click the `Edit` tab
   1. Check the `Login activated` checkbox
   1. Click `Save`
   1. Locate the original `Sold To:` contact in CustomersDot and click `Save` on the `Edit` page to ensure this contact remains the `Sold To:`
