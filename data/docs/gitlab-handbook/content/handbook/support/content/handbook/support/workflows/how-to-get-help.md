## Getting Help on a Ticket

When [working on tickets](/handbook/support/workflows/working-on-tickets), collaboration is critical, especially when troubleshooting complex issues, or technical areas of focus that fall outside of your experience level. Asking for help means having a [low level of shame](/handbook/values/#low-level-of-shame-when-dogfooding), and also shows that you are putting the customer first because you are working towards resolving their problem.

### Ask good questions

Asking a good question is key to getting the help you need. When in doubt, ask yourself:

> Does my question contain all the information that a reader needs to formulate a good response?

A question should include necessary information that helps the reader get up to speed without switching contexts. It
should also include a clear, direct ask. When asking questions, think about the following:

- Does the question have a brief, descriptive summary of the problem?
- Is there a link to the ticket, issue, docs page, or other relevant resource?
- Are there any error messages or behaviors of note that should be included?
- Is the ask clearly stated at the beginning or end of the question?

Starting with a problem summary or overview lets the reader learn about the situation without requiring them to go
somewhere else, like a ticket. Including a link to other material helps the reader gather any additional information
that they might need, like customer details or log files. Highlighting specific error messages or behavior narrows the
scope. Clearly stating your ask at the beginning or end of your question makes it easy for the reader to identify
what you need help with.

These guidelines are a reference, and **not** a requirement for asking questions. They serve as a starting point to
guide you, but don't let them block you from asking for help.

As a final opportunity for reflection, imagine that a GitLab customer is asking you this question. Is there enough
detail for you to begin formulating a response, or would you need to gather more information?

Often, writing a question out functions like [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
That is, the act of thinking through the items above might highlight missing info, cause you to research something you
hadn't before, or even lead you right to the solution.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
While more information is helpful, including too much supporting detail can be confusing. Provide enough information to
satisfy the questions above in your initial post; additional details, such as logs or screenshots, can always be added
to the thread!

### How to Get Help Workflow

If you are stuck on a ticket, the following workflow seeks to help Support Engineers realize and utilize all of the resources available to progress a ticket to resolution. This workflow lists some common resources, you can lean on to get the help you need.

If you're stuck on a ticket, first identify what's causing you to get stuck. Some examples are:

- I don't have the right knowledge to progress this ticket.
- The customer's query is out of scope, but they expect us to resolve this.
- There is a deep technical issue which needs a development expert's consult.

Then consider these options to help unblock you. And remember that
[escalating to unblock](/handbook/values/#escalate-to-unblock)
is an operating principle of Results.

#### Bring the ticket before a group of peers

Other Support Engineers are a great resource to help out with tickets. To get help from peers, you can try one or more of the following:

1. Schedule a pairing session, or attend a crush or help session. This is often the fastest way to get help and learn at the same time. See [getting started with pairing sessions](pairing-sessions.md#getting-started-with-pairing-sessions) for guidance.
1. Ask for help in one of the broader
   [Support Slack channels](/handbook/support/#slack).

#### Expand to Support Pods and other subject matter experts

You can also do one or more of the following:

- See if there is a [Support Pod](/handbook/support/workflows/working-with-pods/) that covers the area your ticket is in and ask one of the Pod members for help.
- Ask an expert within Support. You can check the [Skills by Subject](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/support/team-pages/skills-by-subject.html)
  Support page to see who might have the skills to assist, or reach out
  to the [Support Stable Counterpart](/handbook/support/support-stable-counterparts/)
  for the appropriate product area. Mention those
  people in the thread and in the ticket to let them know you think they can help.
- Reach out to development teams directly in their Slack channels if you have a straightforward,
  specific question that might be quickly answerable. Don't hesitate to engage development teams
  early in the process if their expertise could help resolve an issue more efficiently. Be
  respectful of their time - the development team may direct you to open a formal [request for help issue](#how-to-formally-request-help-from-the-gitlab-development-team)
  if your question requires more detailed information or investigation.
- [Request help from the relevant GitLab Development Team](#how-to-formally-request-help-from-the-gitlab-development-team).
  Gather what information you have and fill in as much detail as possible for the dev team in the issue. To get more attention, you can post in the relevant group Slack channel with a message and link to the issue.
  If you don't get a response within the SLO, contact the listed engineering manager in the project readme.
  See [below](#how-to-formally-request-help-from-the-gitlab-development-team) for more details.
- If you have a reproducible issue, then go straight to a bug issue in the appropriate [GitLab product tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org).

#### Bring the ticket to managers

Especially if you feel you're stalled on a ticket and need assistance identifying next steps:

1. Always feel free to reach out to any available manager (such as your manager, or the [Support Leader on the Hook (SLOTH)](/handbook/support/workflows/support-leader-on-the-hook) in the `#support_leadership` channel. They will help you to determine next steps.
   - Avoid messages with no identified DRI for responding in `#support_leadership` as they can be missed or be a victim to the bystander effect.
1. [Open a STAR](/handbook/support/internal-support/support-ticket-attention-requests#submitting-a-support-ticket-attention-request-star--starring-a-ticket) in situations where getting help is urgent and important because:
   - the customer has expressed unhappiness with the service we're delivering via the ticket
   - the support engineer has noticed a correlation between several of a customers tickets that could use a more cohesive response
   - there is an urgent need for action in a different region (for example, finding a ticket owner or scheduling a call)

### How to formally Request Help from the GitLab Development Team

To enhance collaboration between the support and development teams, GitLab has implemented the Request for Help (RFH) process. This allows support engineers to formally request assistance from the specific GitLab development groups responsible for the relevant functionality when facing technical challenges that impede ticket resolution. This section outlines the necessary steps to effectively utilize the RFH process.

It's important to note that this process is part of a broader, iterative strategy aimed at deploying this workflow across all development sections and groups at GitLab. If an RFH template for a particular development group is not yet available, please reach out to [John Lyttle](https://gitlab.com/jlyttle) to initiate the creation of the required RFH template.

#### Are you requesting for Dev help too soon?

NO! To drive this point home, here's what one of our Developers **Chad Woolley** had to say about this:

> _If both Support and the Customer are confused about what the next steps are, at a minimum it's an indicator that something is lacking, either in our docs or support processes, and this is an opportunity to improve those areas._

#### How to find the correct Development Section and Group to reach out for help

The easiest way to determine the correct place for a Support Request for Help issue is to use the docs pages. One possible workflow is as follows:

1. Locate a documentation page for the feature or topic on which you need help.
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on either the "View page source" link.
1. This will open up the `.md` source file of that docs page, which contains both the `stage` and `group` responsible for it noted on the top.
1. Now go to the [Product Categories handbook page](/handbook/product/categories/) and search for the Development Section to which the group identified on the previous step belongs to.
1. Use the table and workflow below to create a Request for Help issue in the project identified above.

Alternatively, if you have set up the [Support dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/toolbox/dotfiles), you can use the `gls_request_for_help` command to quickly retrieve the "New issue" link with the correct issue template.

_NOTE:_ A video recording of a similar workflow as the one described above can be found in the [Support Training repository](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-training/-/blob/main/Support%20Specific%20Trainings/training-videos/Support%20Request%20for%20Help%20Workflow.mp4)

#### The Request For Help Landing Page

The [Request for Help](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/request-for-help) landing page consolidates all GitLab Development Sections and their respective groups into a single repository. Unlike the previous process, all RFH templates are now centralized within this repository for easier access and management. To submit an issue, navigate to the page, locate the relevant GitLab Group, and click on its "Associated Template."

**Change Process:**
If a section or group has been recently modified, please create a confidential issue in the GitLab project tracker, assign to @jlyttle and notify the relevant Slack channel.
For additional details, refer to the [support epic #222](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/support/-/epics/222) for more information.

#### Research prior to opening an issue

Use the following repositories and resources for identifying similar issues or requests:

1. Zendesk for related tickets.
1. Previous GitLab Application [bugs and feature requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues).
1. Previously submitted GitLab.com issues.
1. Previously submitted [Request for Help](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/request-for-help) issues.
1. Discuss with knowledge experts and support stable counterparts.

#### Create a detailed issue

1. Open the [Request for Help](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/request-for-help) landing page.
1. Review the Development groups and corresponding templates section.
   - Use the provided GitLab Handbook Section Breakdown link at the bottom of the Project ReadMe file if you are unsure about which Section Sub Group and corresponding template to use.
1. Make sure to use the correct corresponding issue template when creating a new issue.
1. Complete all the fields in the issue template and attach all necessary files.
1. Ensure that an appropriate severity is set as defined by the [support impact](https://about.gitlab.com/support/definitions/#definitions-of-support-impact). You should set the appropriate label `severity::1`, `severity::2`, `severity::3`, `severity::4` so that it corresponds with the priority level in Zendesk.
1. If the Zendesk ticket is escalated then add the label `Support::escalated`.
1. Add a 'Customer Impact' statement if necessary, advocating for the customer.
1. Ensure to follow any instructions on the template itself, such as who to assign the issue to (if not automatically assigned).
1. After creating the issue:
   - Add its link to the Zendesk ticket as an internal note and to the ticket field named `GitLab Issues`.
   - Use Duo Chat on the issue to identify any further details/context you should share additionally. You can use a prompt like this:
     > This issue is a request for help from the customer support team to Engineering. Identify any context that has not been shared, but that would be useful for Engineering to help provide a solution for this issue.

#### Preventing Auto-Closure While Awaiting Customer Response

If you are waiting on a response from the customer and need to prevent the RFH issue from auto-closing due to inactivity, manually apply the following label: **`RFH::Awaiting Customer Response`**

**When to use this label:**

- You have asked the customer for additional information or clarification
- You are waiting for the customer to test a proposed solution or workaround
- You need customer input before you can proceed with the investigation
- The issue cannot progress without customer action

#### Closing: Document and Knowledge Share

When closing an RFH issue, ensure you complete the following required actions:

##### 1. Add Closure Comment and Label

Add a comment explaining why the issue is being closed, and apply the appropriate closure reason label:

- `Closed::Bug Fixed` – The issue was resolved with a bug fix
- `Closed::Workaround` – A workaround was provided to resolve the issue
- `Closed::Other Request` – A related feature request or bug report was created in a public tracker, and tracking continues there
- `Closed::Moved to Public Issue` – The issue was moved to a public tracker for continued tracking
- `Closed::No Solution` – No workaround or resolution was found
- `Closed::Insufficient Information` – The RFH could not be acted on due to missing details, or the customer did not respond
- `Closed::Documentation` – Existing documentation was not followed
- `Closed::Out of Scope` – The request was determined to be out of scope for support

##### 2. Update Documentation (If Applicable)

Consider whether the solution or information contained within the issue can be used to update the GitLab documentation:

- If you **have updated** the GitLab documentation, add the label `documentation::created` and link the merge request
- If documentation **should be updated** but you haven't done so, add the label `documentation::candidate` and create a GitLab issue to update the relevant documentation

##### 3. Complete Retrospective (If Applicable)

If the RFH requires a retrospective, ensure it is completed as noted in the [RFH ReadMe](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/request-for-help/-/tree/main#retrospectives) before closing the issue.

#### Tips on getting timely responses

1. Review the Opening a request for help to ensure all steps were covered.
1. Mention the engineer who is helping or assigned with _every_ comment where you need them to review or respond.
1. If an issue is moved to another group (through a label change or moving to another project), check the corresponding template for the new group to see who to assign or mention in a comment.
1. When linking to Kibana, also upload a copy of relevant entries, a screenshot of the graph, etc. as logs rotate out after 7 days. If possible, also link to the relevant Sentry entry.
1. Many teams do not have access to customer information. So make sure if you are accessing information using elevated access (Such as GitLab.com Admin) that you provide information in the issue directly that may be required to understand the problem.

#### When Development Requires Additional Information

Development engineers may apply the `RFH::Needs more info` label to your issue if additional details are needed. This label indicates that your issue requires clarification or additional information to proceed. When you see this label:

1. Review any comments from the development team carefully.
1. Provide all requested information in a new comment.
1. Mention the relevant developer in your response.
1. Ensure you've included a detailed description of the problem, the required logs, screenshots, or the required reproduction steps.

Once you've provided the requested information, the development team will remove the RFH::Needs more info label and continue with the investigation.

Please Note: Providing thorough and prompt responses when this label is applied helps ensure your issue can be investigated and resolved efficiently.

#### Escalate to unblock a request

If your Request for Help has stalled (for example, no response or progress from the Development team) these steps should help unblock the issue. Support is working on behalf of our users; validating that we get a timely answer from the Engineering team helps keep our customers happy.

If a request is blocked or an update has been requested in a support ticket:

1. Check if the assigned engineer is on PTO through Slack or their GitLab status. If they are on PTO, @mention the engineering manager and the contacts listed in the issue template (or their backups if those contacts are also unavailable). Backups are typically listed in a coverage issue or in Slack.
1. Alert the Development Group's Engineering Manager by @mentioning them in the issue. You can identify the relevant EM by checking the Development Group Handbook Page from each Project's README section, which provides a section named `Development Groups with their corresponding templates and labels`.
1. Ping the assigned engineer and/or Engineering Manager in the corresponding product or development group Slack channel, along with a link to the RFH issue, requesting an update.
1. If the above steps have not unblocked the request, reach out to a Support Manager for further guidance directly or in the `#support_leadership` Slack channel.

#### Closing: Document and knowledge share

1. Once you receive all the necessary assistance, ensure to close the issue and add a comment explaining why it is being closed.
1. Consider whether the solution or information contained within the issue can be used to update the GitLab documentation.
   1. If you have updated the GitLab documentation, add the label `documentation::created` and link the merge request.
   1. Otherwise, add the label `documentation::candidate`, and create a GitLab issue to update the relevant documentation.
