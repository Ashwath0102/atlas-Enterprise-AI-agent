## Purpose of this page

This page aims to walk you through some basic checks and items to tick off when triaging tickets in ZenDesk.

## Overview

In previous years, triage of tickets was done in the `Needs Org` queue and required Support Engineers to ensure that tickets were assigned to their organizations with proof of entitlement. Currently, all submitted tickets should have an organization or belong to a free user. Tickets from users who are not listed contacts will automatically be rejected and closed with [instructions on how to become a contact for their organization](https://about.gitlab.com/support/managing-support-contacts/). However, customers may still submit tickets under the wrong forms, so having accurate information helps with reporting and getting the tickets to the right people.

## Applying the Correct Form

A ticket should have the correct form applied to it to help route it to the right set of individuals who can assist with that request.

For tickets submitted using an incorrect form or those that need to be moved to non-support forms, apply the `General::Forms::Incorrect form used` macro. Support Operations will handle the reassignment from there.

### For security related matters

Apply the macro `Security::All Security Questions`. This will reply and mark the ticket `solved`.

### Handling Free User tickets

Free Users who are reporting Self-Managed or SaaS issues

1. Triage the Free User ticket and verify if they are a SaaS user who meets the support criteria outlined in the [free users section of the statement of support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#free-users).
1. If they do not meet the above criteria or the ticket is for a self-managed Free User, in `New` tickets you can select `Free customer` in `Self-Managed Subscription` dropdown, which will activate the [`Auto-close free and self-provisioned trial SM tickets`](https://gitlab.com/search?group_id=2573624&repository_ref=master&scope=blobs&search=id%3A+5475833679900&snippets=false) trigger (responds and solves the ticket). If the ticket is `Open`, then direct the customer to the [GitLab community forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/) via the ["Self-managed or GitLab.com Free User Request" macro](https://gitlab.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group_id=15990755&project_id=17008590&scope=&search_code=true&snippets=false&repository_ref=master&search=id%3A+360044960813) and mark it "Solved". If you wish to provide technical assistance to the user, then please do so via the [GitLab community forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/).

Free Users who are reporting L&R issues

Triage the Free User ticket and verify if the user's issue relates to subscriptions or account/billing listed in the [Applying the Correct Form section](#applying-the-correct-form), change the form to the appropriate one so that a team member can deal with the request directly.

If the user is asking for assistance getting in contact with sales, you can use the "L&R" form.

If the request falls outside of such scenarios, see the [Other Requests section](#other-requests), or direct the user to the [GitLab community forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/) and the ticket marked as "Solved".

## After applying the correct form

- Apply the correct `Support Ticket Category` value if possible.
- If missing, gather information about the `GitLab Install Type`, `Reference Architecture` and `GitLab Version`
- Consider gathering any other information that might be missing if the customer used the incorrect form.

## U.S. Government tickets in Global Support Portal

Users of GitLab's [U.S. Government Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/us-government-support/) offering may opt to raise a ticket in the Global Support Portal as well. The most common reason for this is the need for support outside of the U.S. Government's [hours of operation](https://about.gitlab.com/support/us-government-support/#hours-of-operation). If during the triage process, a Global Agent comes across a ticket that is from an organization which appears to be a customer entitled to U.S. Government Support, the agent can work this case the same as they would any other ticket.

If a ticket is created through the Global Support Portal and a request is made that only agents with U.S. citizenship handle the case, then the agent should direct the customer to file a new case via the U.S. Government Support portal and make their account team aware.
