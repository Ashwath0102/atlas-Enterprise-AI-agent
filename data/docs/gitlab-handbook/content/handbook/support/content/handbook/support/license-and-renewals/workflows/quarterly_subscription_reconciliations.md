description: Workflow for QSR dispute, pausing QSR, resolving max seats, and triggering reconciliation.

## Overview

This page provides guidance for handling tickets about the [quarterly subscription reconciliation process](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation/), including disputes, escalation, pausing QSR, resetting max seats, and how to retry a reconciliation.

## General Workflow

When a customer contacts support regarding QSR, as a first line of contact you can use the [`Support::L&R::Refund or cancellation request on quarterly subscription reconciliation` macro](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-ops/zendesk-global/macros/-/blob/master/macros/active/Support/L&R/Refund%20or%20cancellation%20request%20on%20quarterly%20subscription%20reconciliation.yaml), or you can craft a manual response based on it.  If sending a response in your own words, it's important to follow the general guidelines and information used in the macro to be sure that we are setting appropriate and consistent expectations.

Try to explain QSR, how it works, and consider linking to the [documentation page for it](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation/). There are also individual [SaaS focused](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/gitlab_com/#how-seat-usage-is-determined) and [self-managed focused](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/self_managed/#billable-users) documentation pages explaining how billable seats are calculated.

Refer to [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/support-team-meta/-/issues/3540#quarterly-subscription-reconciliation) for in-depth explanations.

**Do**

- Explain how QSR works, and set appropriate expectations on any next steps.
- Be sure to set the **Transaction Issue Type** to `Quarterly Subscription Reconciliation` for tracking purposes.

**Don't**

- Pass the ticket to Billing/AR.
- [Pause QSR](#pausing-qsr-on-a-subscription), or [reset max seats](#resolving-max-seats-overages) without documented approval.

## Dispute Escalation and Resolution

If the customer would like to dispute a reconciliation, either pending or processed:

- Advise the customer that you will be putting them in contact with their sales account manager.
- Follow the workflow on [Working with Sales](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/working_with_sales/#general-workflow) to inform the account manager in SFDC.
- Do not pause/disable QSR yourself except in extenuating circumstances ([see below](#pausing-qsr-on-a-subscription)).
- Do not reset Max Seats on the namespace ([see below](#resolving-max-seats-overages)).

Given that support team has no influence over the process at this point, direct the customer to continue all discussions with their sales manager, and the ticket may then be closed.

### Pausing QSR on a subscription

**Important:** Support team should not be disabling QSR on a subscription except in the cases of confirmed bug behavior.

1. If QSR needs to be disabled on a subscription due to a customer dispute or any other non-bug issue, refer to the sales-ops handbook page on [How To Temporarily Pause Quarterly Subscription Reconciliation](/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#how-to-temporarily-pause-auto-renewal-quarterly-subscription-reconciliation-and-operational-data).  The sales account manager should be following this workflow to request a temporary pause on QSR.

1. In the event a bug has been confirmed which is causing an incorrect QSR amount to be quoted, due to the time-sensitive nature of reconciliations Support team have the ability to disable QSR manually on a subscription through the customersDot Admin interface, and we should do so in these cases.

   - Navigate to the customer's account and view the Zuora Subscriptions tab (`/admin/customer/:id/zuora_subscriptions`).
   - Use the drop down menu under **Quarterly Coterms** to select Yes/No.
     - Switch to `No`.
   - Click Update.

#### When manually pausing QSR

1. You will need to take responsibility for ensuring that it becomes reactivated after a bug-fix or other work-around has been implemented.
   - Consider the [Zendesk Super App](/handbook/eta/css/zendesk/apps/global#zendesk-super-app), [reminder app](/handbook/eta/css/zendesk/apps/global#gitlab-reminders-app), Slack's built-in reminder tool, or whatever works for you.

## Resolving Max Seats Overages

**Important:** Do not reset a namespace's `Max Seats` without the necessary approvals in chatter. View this step as waiving trueups, and refer to the sales-ops handbook page [Waived True-Ups: Policy and Approval Requirements](/handbook/sales/field-operations/order-processing/#waived-true-ups-policy-and-approval-requirements)

**For Waived True-Ups of 10 seats or less:** Sales can bypass the standard True-Up approval process and submit an internal request through the Zendesk form using the L&R Internal Requests option, followed by reset max seats for QSR. For requests above 10 seats, the required approval must be obtained before Support resets Max Seats.

### Checking for approvals

In the ticket, follow the URL given as `Chattr link containing approval`.

Often, a statement of approval will be given in replies to that chatter on the relevant opportunity.  The approval will come from a leader in sales, typically an area VP.  Hover over the approver's name for details.

When a QSR case is being processed by Deal Desk team, the approval may be on the Salesforce case itself.  On the SFDC case, look for the fields `Approved` and `Approver`, both of which should be marked when the QSR waiver is approved by the relevant approver.

- See [here for more information](/handbook/sales/field-operations/requesting-internal-support/#navigating-an-internal-case) on SFDC cases

If no approval is located in the linked chatter, or the SFDC case, inform the requestor of this fact, and do not proceed.

### When approved

If approvals are given for resetting `Max Seats`, you can use:

- CustomersDot Support Admin Tools > [Reset Max Seats](/handbook/support/license-and-renewals/workflows/customersdot/support_tools/#reset-max-seats)
- console access (last resort)

Document the action in the relevant ticket, or in an [internal-request](https://support-super-form-gitlab-com-support-support-op-651f22e90ce6d7.gitlab.io/). Use the **GitLab Support Internal Requests for Global customers** request option, and **Reset max seats for QSR** for the internal request type. In the case where QSR is approved for refund, approval for `Max seats` reset is still needed.

Be sure that you are setting this value such that it only eliminates the approved and waived overages. In many cases, you can simply set this value to the namespace's current usage, but use some common sense here too like reviewing the ticket, screenshots, customer interactions, etc to be sure you are setting the proper amount.  Ask in slack if you're unsure.

**Important:** If a QSR is refunded, max user count must be reset by opening a ticket with Support. Deal Desk will support this process. [Internal process guide here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/sales-team/field-operations/deal-desk/-/wikis/Web-Direct-Quarterly-Seat-Reconciliation-(QSR)-Refunds).

## Performing reconciliation

The `Perform reconciliation` button, located on the details page of a [Reconciliation](https://customers.gitlab.com/admin/reconciliation/12345), doesn't currently work due to a [bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/issues/4317).

Updating the default credit card in customersdot automatically re-triggers QSR payment (unless something goes wrong). You can see a successful re-trigger by looking at the status of the reconciliation event. The re-trigger can be done up to 3 months after a failed QSR event. If the payment did not get triggered, check that the card is set to default in customersdot.

The customer will receive an [email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/-/blob/main/app/views/reconciliation_mailer/payment_failed.text.erb) when the reconciliation has failed and be provided with instructions on how to retry; this information is also available in our [docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/subscriptions/quarterly_reconciliation#troubleshooting-failed-payment).
