title: "CSE Assigned: Health Assessments & CTAs"
description: "How to run health assessments and use CTAs to track follow-up work for CSE Assigned accounts."

## Health assessments

- **Cadence:** one per account per rolling 90 days (the first quarter of CSE Assigned operation is used to complete the initial full-pass across the entire book).
- **Mandatory sections:** one TL;DR sentence, then an executive overview covering account basics (product/tier/seats/renewal date), usage summary, support, customer interactions, risk assessment, and proposed next steps.
- Health assessments are **internal-facing only**, they are not customer-facing.
- The output lives in the **Gainsight Timeline** as a Health Update entry, it is not automatically a CTA.
- **Suggested method:** run an automated data pull (today via [this script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/csmerm/customer-success-engineering/scale-cse/-/tree/main/CSE%20Health%20Assessment?ref_type=heads)), review and augment with your own account knowledge gained from customer interactions and AE/RM catch-ups, then post the TL;DR + executive summary as a Health Update in Gainsight.
- **If usage data isn't in Gainsight:** check whether the instance is set to "Production," ask the customer directly if needed, and use engagement frequency, interactions, and support tickets as signal in the meantime. Reach out in `#gainsight-users` if something looks technically broken.

## CTAs

- CTAs are **not a performance metric**. They exist to structure work and give portfolio visibility.
- A CTA is only opened when a health assessment surfaces follow-up work, or a customer requests guidance on a specific topic. A healthy account with no follow-up needs no CTA.
- Use the **Lifecycle CTA** type for adoption follow-up: one per account per quarter, with each health-assessment follow-up item as a task inside it (not a separate CTA per item). Close with documented outcomes (topics covered, recommendations with links, customer's next actions).
- Use the **Escalation CTA** type for escalations, following the [CSM escalation process](/handbook/customer-experience/csm/escalations/):
  1. Risk surfaces: health assessment or signal identifies an issue.
  2. Immediate flag: notify AE/RM and CSE manager; don't wait.
  3. Open Escalation CTA: track in Gainsight following the CSM escalation process.
  4. End-to-end ownership: the assigned CSE manages through resolution, with the account team in the loop throughout.
- Customer-introduction CTAs are recommended, not mandatory.

## CTA types at a glance

Beyond Lifecycle and Escalation above, a few other CTA types show up on assigned accounts. Some are CSE-opened, some are system-generated and just need a CSE response:

| Type | Opened by | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| **Lifecycle** | CSE | Non-risk adoption follow-up |
| **Escalation** | CSE (via SFDC case) | Customer in a challenging situation. Tracked in Gainsight under the At-Risk CTA type |
| **At-Risk / Save Play** | CSE | Renewal risk: a Red Review save-play assignment, low adoption, exec change, or budget-risk signals. If an Escalation CTA already exists for the account, add to it rather than opening a parallel Save Play |
| **Activity** | CSE | Personal follow-up items and reminders. Internal-only, not part of portfolio reporting |
| **DAP** | System | Auto-created on a new DAP commitment or near-zero credit burn; CSE owns activation on assigned accounts alongside AE/RM |
| **Onboarding** | System | Auto-created for net-new First Order accounts; CSE is the primary technical contact through kickoff |
| **Digital Journey** | System | Created from a Calendly or digital-touchpoint trigger; review if it lands on an assigned account and escalate to a CSE-led CTA if needed |
| **CSE Case** | System | Support case routed to the CSE queue from Salesforce; if it turns into a real escalation, open a separate Escalation CTA rather than reusing this one |

## Prioritizing which accounts to assess first

Highest ARR + forecast churn/contraction + near-term renewals + worrying adoption patterns, then work down.
